          We at Save the Pitch are on a mission to get young people away from their
          screens and out onto the pitches, playgrounds and cages of inner city London.
          At their best, these shrines to the beautiful game are magnificent, electric
          with energy, passion and fun; players learn and grow, life long friendships
          are made and stars of the game are born. At their worst, they are underused,
          fall into disrepair, and become car parks, building sites and dumping grounds.
          They can seem threatening, where disenfranchised youth go to hang out and cause mischief.

          It doesn’t have to be this way – Through mapping and photographing these
          pitches, let’s open them up to new players and make them inviting, attractive
          and accessible.  Let’s show parents that they are safe and good for their kids.
          Let’s repair them, build more of them, open them for longer.  Let’s use technology
          to get people out there to join games.  Let’s reach more kids that don’t go out and
          get them to play.  Let’s showcase the drama, passion and dreams of the London youth,
          Let’s have more Nutmeg rush than Candy Crush.  Let’s Save The Pitch!
